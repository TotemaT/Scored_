# Scored!

Scored! is a simple Flutter app that allows you to keep track of all countable things.
Use it to keep track of your board games scores, the number of yellow cars you passed, how many times your least favourite politician lied during their speech,...

Unlike the v1 of Scored!, your parties are now saved and can be either restarted from 0 with the same setup, or continued from where it stopped üëç
